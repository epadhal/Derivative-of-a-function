# Derivative-of-a-function
Use MATLAB to find the graph of the derivative of the function: 
𝑓(𝑥) = 5𝑥 2e−0.2xsin(𝑥)
Set up an x-array from 0 to 10 with an increment of 0.01
• Calculate the y-array that matches that x-array
• Find the central difference estimate of the derivative
• Plot the original function and the derivative on two separate graphs
o Include a grid, titles and axis labels
o Set both x axes to run from 0 to 10
